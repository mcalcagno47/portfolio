                        <p class="main">My name is Mark Calcagno, and I am a student at the Northwestern Illinois University Coding Boot Camp. 
                        This is in anticipation of my second career in software design, web development, or any position requiring full-stack or front end code maintence.
                        My career up until this point was teaching, specifically, teaching sixth and seventh grade Math in the Chicago Public School system, a job I held for eight years.
                        I saw great success in my students during that time, and I while have a tremendous love for the craft, I decided now is the time for a change.
                        <br><br>
                        Before I entered the teaching profession, I worked in the IT department at Northeastern Illinois University for four years, working in the telecommunications department.
                        There, my colleague and I located, identified and described every network jack on our four campuses in anticipation for new a Voiceover IP system and a replacement phone
                        for every employee of the University.  At the completion of the project, we began regular checks of the security systems, imaged computers for new or existing employees, and responded
                        to on-site issues with technology. It was an incredibly informative experience, and the problem-solving aspects of that job were my chief reasons for pursuing a career in tech.
