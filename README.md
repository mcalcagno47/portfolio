# portfolio
Name
Mark Calcagno’s web and app development portfolio


Description
The purpose of this project is to showcase my work to those interested in learning more about my abilities.  It describes multiple projects I am proud of, as well as a short bio of myself and ways to contact me.  The links at the top of the page are linked to the sections of the portfolio, and the images will link to projects once completed.


Installation
Installation is unnecessary.  Follow the link  https://mcalcagno47.github.io/portfolio/ to access the portfolio.


Usage
Again, it’s a showcase of my work.  The tab marked, “My Work,” will link to all projects, while the current homepage features my best work.  


Support
Should you encounter any errors, please email me at mcalcagn@gmail.com.  I will repair any mistakes posthaste.


Roadmap
This is what I am capable of at the moment, 2 weeks into my program.  I will be returning regularly to patch and improve the visuals.
